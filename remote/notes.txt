# ðŸ§  SUDOKU RL EXPERIMENT - TECHNICAL DECISIONS & EXPERIMENTATION NOTES

## ðŸŽ¯ CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Multi-Modal Learning Approach
The decision to create 3 distinct experiments stems from exploring different aspects of Sudoku reasoning:
- **Strategic Move**: Teaches incremental decision-making and constraint propagation
- **Complete Solution**: Teaches holistic puzzle understanding and systematic solving
- **Actor-Critic**: Combines action selection with state evaluation for balanced learning

### Why Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct?
- **Size**: 14B parameters provide strong reasoning without excessive memory requirements
- **Instruction Following**: Pre-trained on instruction-following tasks, crucial for structured outputs
- **Thinking Mode**: Built-in reasoning capabilities reduce need for explicit chain-of-thought prompting
- **Token Efficiency**: Efficient tokenization for structured outputs like "R3C4: 7"

## ðŸ”¬ EXPERIMENT-SPECIFIC TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### EXPERIMENT 1: Strategic Move RL

#### Reward Function Design Philosophy:
```python
# Base reward: Correctness is fundamental
base_reward = 2.0 if correct else -1.0

# Strategic bonus: Reward thinking complexity
if naked_single: strategic_score = 1.0      # Obvious move
elif two_choices: strategic_score = 2.0     # Strategic choice
else: strategic_score = 3.0                 # Complex reasoning

# Constraint benefit: Reward moves that help other cells
constraint_benefit = constraints_created * 0.3

# Final reward combines all aspects
total_reward = base_reward + strategic_score * 0.5 + constraint_benefit
```

**Rationale**: This reward structure encourages the model to not just make correct moves, but to think strategically about move ordering and constraint propagation. The scaling factors (0.5, 0.3) were chosen to make strategic thinking meaningful without overwhelming correctness.

#### Why Multi-Step Episodes?
- **Incremental Learning**: Each move builds on previous state
- **Context Awareness**: Model sees consequences of its actions
- **Strategic Sequencing**: Learns optimal move ordering
- **Real Solving Process**: Mimics human puzzle-solving behavior

#### Dynamic Episode Length Innovation:
Instead of fixed 20-move episodes, we use `len(puzzle_data.empty_cells)` as max_moves. This means:
- Easy puzzles (17-35 empty cells): Shorter episodes, faster training
- Hard puzzles (45-65 empty cells): Longer episodes, more learning opportunities
- **Result**: Optimal resource allocation based on puzzle complexity

### EXPERIMENT 2: Complete Solution RL

#### Single-Step Episode Design:
```python
# Episode structure: One puzzle â†’ One complete solution attempt
class CompleteSolutionEpisode:
    terminal: bool = True  # Always single-step
    solution_completeness: float  # Coverage metric
    solution_accuracy: float      # Precision metric
```

**Rationale**: Complete solution requires different cognitive skills than incremental solving. Single-step episodes force the model to:
- Develop systematic solving strategies
- Maintain global puzzle state awareness
- Generate coherent complete solutions
- Balance speed vs. thoroughness

#### Reward Function Philosophy:
```python
# Reward complete solution quality
base_reward = correct_cells * 2.0 - incorrect_cells * 1.0
perfect_bonus = 50.0 if all_correct else 0.0
coverage_bonus = 10.0 * (attempted_cells / total_empty_cells)
accuracy_bonus = 15.0 * (correct_cells / attempted_cells)
```

**Design Thinking**: The reward emphasizes both coverage (attempting all cells) and accuracy (getting them right). The perfect solution bonus (50.0) creates a strong incentive for complete correctness, while coverage/accuracy bonuses encourage partial solutions over no attempts.

#### Why Lower Learning Rate (3e-6)?
Complete solutions generate much longer sequences, leading to:
- Higher gradient magnitudes
- More volatile training dynamics
- Need for more conservative updates
- **Result**: 3e-6 vs. 5e-6 for strategic moves provides stability

### EXPERIMENT 3: Actor-Critic RL

#### Dual-Network Architecture Decision:
```python
# Actor: Language model for action selection
actor_loss = -log_prob * advantage

# Critic: Linear layer for value estimation  
critic_loss = MSE(predicted_values, target_returns)

# Separate optimizers with different learning rates
actor_lr = 4e-6
critic_lr = 40e-6  # 10x higher for faster value learning
```

**Rationale**: Value functions typically need faster learning than policy functions because:
- Value estimation is regression (continuous output)
- Policy learning is classification (discrete actions)
- Critic provides training signal for actor
- **Result**: 10x learning rate difference balances learning speeds

#### Value Function Design:
The critic estimates "how good is this puzzle state?" on 0.0-1.0 scale:
- 0.0: Impossible/contradiction state
- 0.5: Neutral progress state
- 1.0: Nearly solved state

This provides learning signal for advantage calculation: `advantage = returns - values`

#### Why Actor-Critic for Sudoku?
- **Baseline Reduction**: Value function reduces reward variance
- **Faster Learning**: More stable gradients than pure policy gradient
- **State Evaluation**: Explicit state value learning
- **Exploration**: Better exploration through advantage-based updates

## ðŸ”„ MULTI-TURN INTERACTION DESIGN

### Strategic Decision: Update Puzzle State Between Moves
```python
# Turn 1: Model sees original puzzle
prompt = create_prompt(original_puzzle)
response = model.generate(prompt)  # "R3C4: 7"

# Turn 2: Model sees puzzle WITH its previous move
current_puzzle[2][3] = 7  # Apply move
prompt = create_prompt(current_puzzle)  # Updated state
response = model.generate(prompt)  # "R1C5: 2"
```

**Critical Design Choice**: This creates a conversational solving experience where the model:
- Sees consequences of its actions
- Builds upon previous decisions
- Learns strategic move sequencing
- Develops coherent solving strategies

**Alternative Rejected**: Showing original puzzle + move history would be less intuitive and harder to parse.

## ðŸŽ­ PROMPT ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY

### Minimalist Approach:
```python
# BEFORE: Verbose, technique-heavy prompts
"Use elimination, naked singles, hidden pairs, box-line reduction..."

# AFTER: Clean, goal-oriented prompts
"Think step by step and choose the most strategic move."
```

**Rationale**: Qwen2.5-14B with thinking mode has built-in reasoning. Over-constraining with specific techniques can:
- Limit creative problem-solving
- Force artificial technique usage
- Reduce model flexibility
- **Result**: Cleaner prompts let the model use its full reasoning capability

### Structured Output Format:
```xml
<answer>R3C4: 7</answer>
<value>0.85</value>
```

**Design Choice**: XML-like tags provide:
- Clear parsing boundaries
- Unambiguous output format
- Easy regex extraction
- Consistent across experiments

## ðŸ“Š DATASET OPTIMIZATION DECISIONS

### Balanced Difficulty Distribution:
```python
# TRAIN: Stratified by difficulty categories
train_distribution = {
    "beginner": 0.3,    # 75+ clues
    "easy": 0.25,       # 65-74 clues
    "medium": 0.2,      # 55-64 clues
    "hard": 0.15,       # 45-54 clues
    "expert": 0.08,     # 35-44 clues
    "master": 0.02      # <35 clues
}

# TEST: Equal representation of ALL clue counts
test_distribution = "uniform across 17-80 clues"
```

**Rationale**: 
- **Training**: Focus on learnable difficulties (more easy/medium puzzles)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive evaluation across all difficulties
- **Result**: Better training efficiency while maintaining evaluation rigor

### Size Reduction Strategy:
Original dataset: 4M puzzles â†’ Final dataset: 1,984 puzzles (2000x reduction)

**Time Constraints**: 24-hour A100 rental requires aggressive optimization:
- 1,344 train samples Ã— 600 episodes = 806,400 training instances
- ~2-4 seconds per inference = 20-22 hours total
- **Result**: Maximum dataset size for time constraint

## ðŸ§® TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS

### Model Path Standardization:
```python
# OLD: Complex if-else logic
if path.exists(): load_from_path()
else: load_base_model()

# NEW: Clean type-based loading
model_paths = {
    "base": "models/base_model",
    "trained": "models/experiment_X_final_model"
}
```

**Benefit**: Eliminates path confusion, enables consistent benchmarking, reduces error potential.

### Full Interaction Logging:
```python
interaction = {
    'move_number': move_count + 1,
    'prompt': full_prompt,
    'full_response': complete_model_output,
    'generated_response': new_tokens_only,
    'puzzle_state_before': puzzle_copy,
    'puzzle_state_after': updated_puzzle,
    'move_valid': True/False,
    'move_correct': True/False
}
```

**Purpose**: Complete traceability for:
- Debugging training issues
- Analyzing model behavior
- Understanding failure modes
- Post-experiment analysis

### Memory Optimization Choices:
- **Batch Size**: 3-4 (memory-constrained for 14B model)
- **Precision**: FP16 throughout (halves memory usage)
